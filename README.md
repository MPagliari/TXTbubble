# Text Bubble Generator

This Python script allows you to generate text message "bubbles" similar to those seen in mobile messaging applications. It takes a sentence as input and creates a visually appealing bubble with the text wrapped inside it. The bubbles can be customized for different senders and receivers.

## Usage

To use the script, simply call the `DrawTextBubble` function with the text you want to display inside the bubble. You can also specify the filename for the output image and whether the bubble is being sent or received.

```python
DrawTextBubble("Hi could you please buy some milk on your way home.", "sender.png", transmition="Tx")
```

## Features

- **Text Wrapping**: Long sentences are automatically split and wrapped inside the bubble for better readability.
- **Customization**: Bubbles can be customized for different senders and receivers, with different colors and orientations.

## Note

Please be aware that this code is still in development and may contain rough edges. Feel free to contribute improvements or report any issues you encounter.
